    <p>Anthony Davis got most of his points with a feathery shooting touch. LeBron James flexed <br> 
        his muscle to bulldoze his way to damage. And whenever the lead looked even the tiniest <br> 
        bit threatened, the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/los-angeles-lakers"> Los Angeles Lakers</a> had an answer.
    </p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nba-finals"> NBA finals </a> are halfway to a coronation.</p>
    <p>James finished with 33 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, Davis made 14 of his first 15 <br> 
        shots on the way to 32 points, and the Lakers took a 2-0 lead in the title series by beating <br> 
        the shorthanded Miami Heat 124-114 on Friday night. The Lakers shot 51%, making 16 consecutive <br> 
        shots from two-point range in a stretch that started late in the first quarter and ended late in the third.</p>
    <p>James and Davis were the first Lakers duo to score at least 32 points in a finals game since <br> 
        Game 3 against New Jersey in 2002, when Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant did it.</p>
    <p>“It’s very humbling that we can be even mentioned with those greats,” James said.</p>
    <p>Shaq and Kobe got rings that year.</p>
    <p>James and Davis are two wins away.</p>
    <p>“Those guys are playing at an extremely high level, and hopefully we can get two more wins,” <br> 
        Lakers coach Frank Vogel said.</p>
    <p>Jimmy Butler finished with 25 points, 13 assists and eight rebounds for Miami, which played <br> 
        without injured starters Bam Adebayo (neck and left shoulder) and Goran Dragić (torn left plantar fascia). <br> 
        The Heat scored 39 points in the third quarter and that was only good enough to cut a 14-point halftime <br> 
        deficit to a 10-point hole going into the fourth, mainly because they just couldn’t get enough stops.</p>
    <p>“Look, I love these guys. I love the way we compete,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “We have to figure <br> 
        out how to overcome this and get over the top.”</p>
    <p>Game 3 is Sunday night. It’s unclear if Dragić, Adebayo or both could return; each lobbied to play <br> 
        Friday night, before the Heat had to make the call to keep them sidelined.</p>
    <p>It’s also unclear how much it will matter.</p>
    <p>This is the 24th time that James has had a 2-0 series lead; his teams in Cleveland, Miami and LA are 23-0 <br> 
        in the previous instances. And the last time the Lakers franchise wasted a 2-0 lead was in the 1969 finals <br> 
        against Boston.</p>
    <p>“Until we win four games, we haven’t accomplished our goal,” Lakers guard Alex Caruso said. <br> 
        “It’s been over a year together and we’ve talked about the same goal from day one. We’re still here <br> 
        chasing that same goal. Until we get four wins, we’re staying hungry.”</p>
    <p>Kelly Olynyk scored 24 points for the Heat, who trailed by as many as 32 in Game 1 and <br> 
        – even without Adebayo and Dragić – were far more competitive in Game 2. Miami got within nine points <br> 
        in the fourth, but never got close enough to truly put a scare into the Lakers.</p>
    <p>“Maybe we’ve just got to play a lot harder, to know that’s how we’re going to squeak out a win in the end,” <br> 
        Butler said. “There really isn’t too much to say to our guys. We understand what we have to do.”</p>
    <p>Tyler Herro had 17, Kendrick Nunn scored 13 and Jae Crowder had 12 for the Heat. Herro and Meyers <br> 
        Leonard took Dragić’s and Adebayo’s spots in the starting lineup.</p>
    <p>“We had it right there on the edge, but we just couldn’t push it over,” Olynyk said. “We can build on that.”</p>
    <p>Rajon Rondo had 16 points, while Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Kyle Kuzma each had 11 for the Lakers – <br> 
        who improved to 4-0 in these playoffs when wearing the Kobe Bryant-inspired ‘Black Mamba’ uniforms, <br> 
        one of many tributes to the Lakers legend who died on 26 January in a helicopter crash.</p>
    <p>“This is what it’s all about,” James said. “We’re thinking about the Bryant family ... and hopefully <br> 
        we’re making them proud.”</p>
